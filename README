This script automatically posts the latest entry from an RSS feed to twitter using PHP. This uses the twitteroauth library from abraham: https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth 

-----

To install, fill in the fields in rssmonitor.php with your twitter keys:

You can get these at http://dev.twitter.com by making a new application, you need to change the privileges to read and write and generate oAuth keys. 
Also fill in the RSS feed url which is just below the twitter oAuth keys.

Also upload all the files to a remote server or a local one.

It is best practice to run in the shell:

php rssmonitor.php

But you can run in some browsers, I have tried on Google Chrome for Mac and it has worked.
